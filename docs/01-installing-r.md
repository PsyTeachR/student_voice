# AY2024-2025

This represents a summary of the main changes made to each level and programme in the academic year 2024-2025.

## Level 1 psychology

-   Students asked for more support on the essay and data skills, so we have removed the group project from Psych 1A and are using the two labs this frees up for one extra lab on each. The essay deadline has been moved to week 9 to accommodate the extra week of lab support.

-   Data Skills 1 is now summative (to replace the 5% group project) but is a mark for participation. Data Skills 3 will now be done in the lab rather than as a homework and will be a mark for participation but requires attendance at 6/8 labs across the semester to encourage consistent engagement.

-   We have removed the use of PeerWise as the use of external platforms was causing some administrative chaos and instead, we have weekly practice MCQs. We also replaced the questions that were previously based on the reading with questions specific to the lecture ILOs.

-   For Psych 1B, we have also reduced the number of data skills assessments from three to two. Data skills 2 will now be a bigger single assessment worth 10% and will require students to complete a write-up of the project results in a more authentic and meaningful format.

-   The Level 1 exam has returned to being in-person to ensure that we can maintain academic integrity and that students acquire foundational knowledge.

## Level 2 psychology

-   Students said that data skills learning as a solely independent task is too challenging and the chapters in the Analysis R Book are too long and complicated. To address this, we integrated data skills as dedicated pair coding exercises into the labs. We have completely rewritten the Analysis R Book adding more structure and making chapters more concise.

```
-   Students said that there was a high workload due to the number of assessments and tasks. To address this, we have reduced the workload by reducing the number of data skills assessments from 3 to 2 assessments and doing one of the assessments during lab time. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Students said there was a suboptimal assessment and activities placement during the semester – particularly in the run up to report submission. To address this, we have reshuffled the assessments and Analysis R chapters. There are now no new chapters and no other assessments in weeks 6, 7, and 8. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Students said there was some overlap of content between lectures semester 1 and 2. To address this, we have removed a lecture in semester 1 and have substituted with a brand-new one. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Students said they wanted more exam preparation. To address this, we are increasing our exam preparation resources and support this year. We added a Study Club that will take place 4 times in semester 1 as a trial. We have added an exam prep lab that was written by student interns (delivered in Week 10). We will have a mock exam in Week 11. CKT has re-written her three lectures on Time Management and Study Skills to provide more guidance. 

## Level 3 psychology

## Level 3 neuroscience

## Level 4 psychology

-   Students asked for the dissertation supervisor allocation process to be earlier so as not to interfere with peak periods of assessment. For those entering L4 in 24/25 we thus instigated a revised allocation process that took place earlier in semester, was not time sensitive, nor ‘first-come-first-served'. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Students raised a concern around differential experiences in supervision. Although all supervisors have individual styles, in the short-term we shared guidance and best practice with both students and staff about key milestones and timeframes for dissertation projects and we continue to collect and share information about different models of supervision. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-    We included writing support sessions to develop understanding of specific points of difference between dissertation writing and standard report writing. These also operated as informal Q&A sessions before students shared drafts with supervisors 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-    Analysis support sessions were already standard in semester 2 but additional sessions were scheduled for semester 1 to support students who were doing secondary data analyses  

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-    We continue to review the balance of coursework and exams between first and second semesters but acknowledge that all students have a different preference between balance assessment types and managing dissertation responsibilities. 

## Level 4 neuroscience

## MSc Psychological Science & Studies

-   Moved RM1 and RM2 lectures earlier in the week, so that all labs are timetabled to take place after the lecture (Psychological Science & Psychological Studies) 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Moved forward formative deadlines for Dissertation work (semester 2) to avoid bottleneck with coursework and exam deadlines that 1) caused additional stress 2) led to some students then being really delayed getting Ethics Approval for their study, which caused more stress down the line (Psychological Science) 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   We will be providing more wrap-around support for Dissertation Ethical Applications this AY, with some recorded content and a wider range of examples (Psychological Science) 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Changed lab content to provide some support for data skills within RM1 lab sessions (Psychological Science & Psychological Studies) 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   During 23-24, students asked for careers talks from people on further Psychology degrees at various points in their Psychology careers. In Semester 2, the Mental Health & Wellbeing Network organised a talk from a Clinical Psychologist about her career. Students were also able to participate in a careers event held by RaEN and Psychology Journeys within the School of Psychology & Neuroscience, with speakers from a variety of Psychology career paths. We also have plans to run talks from doctoral students pursuing professional Psychology careers (e.g. Counselling Psychology) in the future (Psychological Studies) 

## MSc Psychological Science (ODL)

-   Added ‘catch up’ sessions in the middle of Year 3 as they said they felt isolated. These were informal sessions for students to meet up online. Feedback on these was positively received. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Students did not like the inconsistency of course material on moodle so we made a decision to create our own ODL moodle template aligning with the university template to promote consistency. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-    Students found it hard to navigate messages on the course teams channels for different weeks. We have now asked course leads to post a weekly message to signpost discussion of weekly content. 

## Research Methods of Psychological Science

## Brain Sciences

-    Students requested more support to write critical reviews. More references and support material were presented at the induction. An extra critical review will be introduced in semester 2 as part of the Designing a Research Project course, which will help consolidate their critical skills in preparation for the final project report and the viva.  

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-    Students commented on the DRP course being a bit too broad in scope, covering all biosciences. We have submitted a proposal to take over that teaching to refocus it entirely on Brain Sciences, including a range of teachers to cover various areas of the field.
